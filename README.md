### Codeforces Profile Analysis Tool

##### Problem Statement: Fragmented Information and Analysis
Competitive programmers, ranging from novices to seasoned experts, often face the challenge of managing and comprehending the data associated with their Codeforces profiles. The existing issues can be summarized as follows:
•	Fragmented Data Sources: Competitive programmers rely on multiple sources and tools to analyze their performance. They need to juggle between Codeforces, third-party contest platforms, and various data analysis tools, making the process fragmented and time-consuming.
•	Limited Data Insights: While Codeforces provides a wealth of information, it lacks in-depth data visualization and analysis capabilities. Users may struggle to gain actionable insights from their contest history, problem-solving statistics, and rating changes.
•	Contest Information Accessibility: Accessing information about upcoming contests, contest ratings, and user participation in real-time is not straightforward. Competitive programmers often rely on external websites and manual tracking, leading to inefficiencies.
•	Lack of User Engagement Tools: Competitive programmers benefit from motivation and engagement tools such as personalized statistics, progress tracking, and the ability to explore unsolved problems.
